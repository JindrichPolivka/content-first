# Visual identity for a small Prague  theatre
The plain look reflects look of the stage and auditorium as well as nature of the plays presented in it. These often use little to none in terms of scenery and costumes. The stage also host intimate musical performances and book readings besides theatrical plays.

The new logo matches look of the sign that has been hanging over the front entrance forever and so it already works as a part of the theatres identity. The word „DIVADLO“ is ommited in our logo as viola is a name that brings enough recognition in itself. Further it has been only slightly adjustedto appear better in print

Posters work with a portrait of the leading actor(s), which alludes to the intimate nature of this space, in which the actors are within an arms reach. In case of this theatre the casting is typically more of a pull for it‘s audience than a given play as for it‘s small size it brings impressive starpower. The typography then follows this unconventional practice with the casting in largest size, followed by the play‘s name set in all caps.

In case of this format not being applicable, the name of the play and castin change places and and are accompanied by a photograph from the play depicting an action rather than a portrait.

Performances aiming at children use a full color image and carrry a  „for children“ tag.

All information in the program follows typographical rules set fo our posters. Hosting performance falls in line chronologically, but is highlighted with horizontal lines.

Two prints of the program can be placed into the information display continuusly flowing from one side to the next. Meaning only one kind of program needs to be designed and printed each month.

### Posters work with a civil portrait of the leading actor(s) from other environments than the stage. This further alludes to the intimate nature of this space, in which the actors are within an arm's reach. Besides, in case of this theatre the casting is greater enticement for the audience than a specific play. As for it‘s small size it brings impressive starpower.
